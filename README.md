# Peninsula Patrol
### Scouting App for FRC6036 2025 Reefscape Season  

PeninsulaPatrol was the scouting system used by FRC6036 for the 2025 Reefscape season. It was a mobile PWA that featured a dynamic queuing system to assign robots to different scouts.

## Features

- **Home Page** with links for sites involving the competition as well as the option to queue
- **Admin Dashboard** where you can set the event as well as queue matches and monitor the scouting progress of the scouts, a route that had advanced security measures and definetly not just putting "admin" in the username.
- **Three Page Scouting Match Scouting Carousel** for Auto, Teleop, and Endgame, with a very intuitive UI of clicking the game piece, the scoring location, and its succesfulness. 
- **Upload to Google Sheets** for versatility, being able to be input to Lighthouse (the offseason data visualization app) as well as being exported into Tableau.
- **Stored QR codes and a scanner** for offline scouting, as long as the scout has already loaded the event
